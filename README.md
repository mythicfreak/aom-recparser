# AoM Recorded Game Parser

This PHP script can parse .rec and .rcx files and extract metadata out of it. This includes some data in XML format and a copy of the Random Map Script (RMS) used during the game. The game itself is capable of extracting user actions and replaying those at real time, but that is beyond the scope of this project.
